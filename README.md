🧘‍♀️ Philosophy

Reflectly is your digital retreat — a quiet space to check in with yourself, track your habits, and find moments of clarity. It’s built around intentional living, not data collection. Your entries are yours alone.


---

🔐 Privacy First

Your journal is stored securely using Firebase Firestore.

Each user’s data is linked to their Firebase Auth account — no one else can access it.

No tracking, no ads, no analytics.
